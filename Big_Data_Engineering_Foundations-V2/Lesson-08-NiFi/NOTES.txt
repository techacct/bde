OS: Linux, Platform: CentOS 7.7
Virtual Machine: LHM V2-beta8 (or higher)

Preparation Needed to Run NiFi
------------------------------

# NiFi can use a lot of system resources and is not started when the LHM starts. 
# In addition, before starting NiFi, it also a good idea to shutdown some unused 
# and resource intensive services (HBase and Kafka).

# Perform the following steps to shutdown Kafka and HBase
# and start NiFi.

# 1. Make sure there are no active Kafka or HBase examples running and
     the KafkaEsque GUI has been stopped (simply close the KafkaEsque window).

# 2. Promote yourself to "root" (password is "hadoop")

    $ su - root 
    # systemctl stop hbase
    # systemctl stop kafka

# 3. Start NiFi 

    # systemctl start nifi
    # exit
    $

# 4. Check if Nifi is running by entering the following in a local browser.
#    IMPORTANT: It may take several minutes for the NiFi interface to start.

  http://localhost:18085/nifi/

# NOTE 1: After a certain amount of idle time the NiFi canvas web UI becomes
# unresponsive. The page must stopped and restarted (not just reloaded) to bring 
# the NiFi canvas back into operation.
#
# NOTE 2: If you restart the LHM, both Kafka and HBase will be running. NiFi
# is not started automatically. You will need to go through the
# above procedure to start NiFi (and shutdown HBase and Kafka if needed)

Place the NiFI-Examples.tgz in /tmp
-----------------------------------

# Copy the NiFi example to the /tmp directory

  cp NiFi-Examples.tgz /tmp 

Work from nifi account
======================

# Nifi is run as user nifi. Because some of the examples require reading and
# writing to the local LHM filesystem (and HDFS) it is easier to run the examples
# as user nifi. The following steps will make you the nifi user and then allow you
# to extract Lesson 8.2 and 8.3 files into the /home/nifi directory. All examples 
# will be run as user nifi. The nifi password is "nifiLHM".
  
  $ su - nifi
  $ whoami
  nifi
  $ pwd
  /home/nifi/

# If you have successfully become the nifi users the whoami and pwd results should
# be the same as shown above.

# Next extract the examples:

  $ tar xvzf /tmp/NiFi-Examples.tgz

# Continue as user nifi and consult the NOTES.txt file in 

  /home/nifi/Lesson-08-NiFi/8.2-NiFi-Flow-Componentsi/NOTES.txt  
  /home/nifi/Lesson-08-NiFi/8.3-Nifi-Web-Example/NOTES.txt


Restore HBase and Kafka
========================

# When you are done with Nifi or would like to use HBase or Kafka
# you can stop NiFi and restart HBase and Kafka as follows:

  $ su - root
  # systemctl stop nifi
  # systemctl start hbase
  # systemctl start kafka
  # exit
  $
