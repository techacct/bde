Kafka Version: 2.12
Python Version: 3.7.4
OS: Linux, Platform: CentOS 7.7
Virtual Machine: LHM V2-beta8

# Kafka web page 
#    https://kafka.apache.org/
# Kafka Python
#    https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.0/index.html
# Python NOAA SDK 
#    https://github.com/paulokuong/noaa
#
# IMPORTANT 1:
#   Make sure you have installed the following Python libraries for
#   example: (These should be installed on the LHM, perform as root)
      pip install noaa-sdk
      pip install kafka-python
# IMPORTANT 2:
#   Make sure the topic weather is created before running
#   producers and consumers

  kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 \
    --partitions 1 --topic weather

# Note The default Log retention time is 7 days (168 hours)
# Unless cleared as mentioned in Lesson 7.2

# Simple Kafka weather example:

#  Producer (w-producer.py) - gets NOAA weather forecast for a US zipcode, 
#                             sends to Kafka weather topic. Runs one time.
#  Consumer (w-consume.py) - waits for most recent message in Kafka weather
#                            topic. When received, creates a pandas dataframe
#                            and reports short weather forecast. Continues to
#                            wait for next message.
