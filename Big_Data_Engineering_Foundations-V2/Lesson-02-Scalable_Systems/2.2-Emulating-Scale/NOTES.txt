Lesson 2.2 Emulating Scalable Systems 

Date: 2021-07
OS: Linux, Platform: CentOS 7.7
Virtual Machine: LHM V2-beta6
============================================================


# In this lesson, we go over how to login to the LHM and download the lesson
# notes. To download and install the virtual machine, refer to the following 
two pages for full documentation (Including video instructions).

Quick Start Instructions Follow
===============================

# If you are using Windows, you will need an "ssh client." Either of these listed
# below will work. They are both freely available at no cost. (MobaXterm is recommended)

#  1. Putty: http://www.putty.org (provides terminal for ssh session)
#  2. MobaXterm: http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net (provides terminal for 
#     ssh sessions and allows remote X Windows session)

# Install VirtualBox, download and start the LHM virtual machine.
# When the VM is started:

# Open a terminal (using Putty or MobaXterm on Windows) and enter the following
# to log in to the LHM-VM as user "hands-on"  (password="minimal")

  ssh hands-on@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

# Once you are logged in to the LHM-VM, you should see the following prompt string:

  [hands-on@localhost ~]$  

# The "[hands-on@localhost ~]" will not be shown in the rest of the class documentation.
# A "$" will indicate the prompt string for input.

# To get the Lesson notes into the LHM-VM, pull down and extract the course files
# (from inside the LHM-VM) as shown below:

  $ wget  --no-check-certificate https://www.clustermonkey.net/download/LiveLessons/Big_Data_Engineering_Foundations/Big_Data_Engineering_Foundations-V1.tgz

# Extract the archive file using the "tar" command:

  $ tar xvzf Big_Data_Engineering_Foundations-V1.tgz

# Verify that you have extracted the course material by listing the directory and
# archive file.

  $ ls 
  Big_Data_Engineering_Foundations-V1  Big_Data_Engineering_Foundations-V1.tgz
